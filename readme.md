# Game Of Life
## Rules:
1. **Births**: Each dead cell adjacent to exactly three live neighbors will become live in the next generation.
2. **Survival**: Each live cell with either two or three live neighbors will remain alive for the next generation.
3. **Death by isolation**: Each live cell with one or fewer live neighbors will die in the next generation.
4. **Death by overcrowding**: Each live cell with four or more live neighbors will die in the next generation.
